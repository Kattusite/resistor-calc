# TODO: Some units can't be negative (ohms, seconds, etc.)
# should I explicitly prevent negative numbers?
# I think no -- maybe we'd like to compute an offset (e.g. R1 - R2) and
# negative numbers would be convenient.
# It should probably be caller's job to check for negativity if it matters to
# them (i.e. in Resistor)
